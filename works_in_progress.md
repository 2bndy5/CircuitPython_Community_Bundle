# Community Modules: Works In Progress

This is a list of links to CircuitPython modules from the community
that are not ready to be submitted to the Community Bundle, but that
the author would like to inform others of the module's existence.

If you've written a CircuitPython driver that you'd like to make
available but don't feel it's ready for the Community Bundle, feel
free to add a link to the GitHub repo below. 

If you'd like to see a driver listed below included in the 
Community Bundle, consider contacting the author to see how you can
help get the driver ready for the Bundle.
